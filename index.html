            <p class="place__paragraph">Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on the shores of
                the Dnipro
                river.
                Of course, no one in their right mind would swim in the river, unless they grew up here, in which
                case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are hot here, and the winters are drafty,
                but the fall and the spring are are absolutely amazing.</p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet
                architecture,
                all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the
                landscape
                is difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing heels. The left bank is considered
                far
                less interesting and prestigious though, even by people who live on the far outskirts of the right
                one.</p>
