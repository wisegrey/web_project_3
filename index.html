                    shores of
                    the Dnipro
                    river.
                    Of course, no one in their right mind would swim in the river, unless they grew up here, in which
                    case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are hot here, and the winters are drafty,
                    but the fall and the spring are are absolutely amazing.</p>
                <p class="place__paragraph">The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet
                    architecture,
                    all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the
                    landscape
                    is difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing heels. The left bank is considered
                    far
                    less interesting and prestigious though, even by people who live on the far outskirts of the right

                    that juts out into the sea. It is thought to have been built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th
                    century. Some 900 years later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of Snowdonia has become
                    a popular tourist destination during the summer months.</p>
                <p class="place__paragraph">A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the world's best
                    ice cream at Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another
                    claim to fame is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom award for five years in a row for its
                    spectacular floral displays around town. It was also home to David Lloyd George, the only Welshman
                    ever to hold the office of Prime Minister of the UK.</p>

                <p class="place__paragraph">Berea is a small town located in the central part of Kentucky. The town is
                    surrounded by beautiful forests and countryside. It's known as the arts and crafts capital of the
                    state, and visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities: shops with handmade jewelry,
                    candles, wood items, galleries, glass studios, and more. The town holds a yearly festival
                    celebrating "spoonbread", a local dish made with cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.</p>
                <p class="place__paragraph">However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea College was
                    founded in 1855 and was the first college in the south to be racially integrated, as well as the
                    first to be coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no tuition — every student receives a
                    full-tuition scholarship.</p>

                <p class="place__paragraph">Muramvya is one of the 18 provinces of Burundi. In the kingdom era, Muramvya
                    was the royal capital and in 2007, because of its cultural and natural landscape, it was added to
                    the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. It is located in the center of Burundi, between the
                    country's political and economic capitals</p>
                <p class="place__paragraph">The weather is rather chilly at night, but during the day, you would think
                    you're in heaven. At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft) above sea level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest
                    places in the province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest plantations of tea and
                    coffee in the country, which make up the bulk of Burundi's exports.</p>
                <p class="place__paragraph">The Kibira National Park, one of the largest wildlife reserves for apes,
                    overlaps four provinces, including Muramvya. This National Park lies at the apex of the beautiful
                    mountains of the Congo-Nile Divide, ranging between 1550 and 2660 meters of altitude. It is filled
                    with beautiful vegetation, and a source for the various rivers and streams which provide water
                    around the country.</p>

                    third-largest city in Israel—after Jerusalem and Tel Aviv—with a population of 285,316 in 2019. The
                    city of Haifa forms part of the Haifa metropolitan area, the third-most populous metropolitan area
                    in Israel. It is home to the Baháʼí Faith's Baháʼí World Centre, and is a UNESCO World Heritage
                    Site and a destination for Baháʼí pilgrimage.</p>
                <p class="place__paragraph">Built on the slopes of Mount Carmel, the settlement has a history spanning
                    more than 3,000 years. The earliest known settlement in the vicinity was Tell Abu Hawam, a small
                    port city established in the Late Bronze Age (14th century BCE). In the 3rd century CE, Haifa was
                    known as a dye-making center. Over the millennia, the Haifa area has changed hands: being conquered
                    and ruled by the Canaanites, Israelites, Phoenicians, Persians, Hasmoneans, Romans, Byzantines,
                    Arabs, Crusaders, Ottomans, and the British. Since the establishment of the Israeli state in 1948,
                    the Haifa Municipality has governed the city.</p>
